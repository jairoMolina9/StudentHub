# CUNYHACKATHON2018

With a group of 5 other individuals, we created a functional app that allows CUNY Students to register, share their majors, interests, and other likings so our app can match them and help them meet people that they will not normally talk to.

The main idea of this project was to encorouge communication between CUNY students from different schools, especially during finals, when maybe you can learn more material from someone that is taking your same class but at a different University. 

Our map API is not yet integrated but it will allow us to get the location of the users, and if they decide to meet we will find the nearest library or public space for them to study.

We primarily used Javascript (React)
